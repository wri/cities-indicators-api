# API Best Practices

Building a REST API requires careful planning and adherence to best practices to ensure that the API is robust, scalable, and easy to use. Here are some key best practices:

## 1. **Use Proper HTTP Methods**
   - **GET**: Retrieve data.
   - **POST**: Create new resources.
   - **PUT**: Update or replace existing resources.
   - **PATCH**: Partially update existing resources.
   - **DELETE**: Remove resources.

## 2. **Follow RESTful Resource Naming Conventions**
   - Use **nouns** to represent resources (e.g., `/cities`, `/indicators`).
   - Use **plural** names (e.g., `/cities` instead of `/city`).
   - Use **sub-resources** to represent relationships (e.g., `/cities/{city_id}/{admin_level}/geojson/indicators`).
   - Use only underscores and lower case in column names.
   - Avoid spaces and capitals in values that will be used as filters in URLs. Default to underscores instead of spaces.
   - URL file paths should have no spaces or capital letters. Default to dashes instead of spaces.

## 3. **Use Proper HTTP Status Codes**
   - **200 OK**: Successful GET, PUT, or DELETE operations.
   - **201 Created**: Successful POST operation.
   - **204 No Content**: Successful request with no content to return.
   - **400 Bad Request**: Client-side input fails validation.
   - **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required.
   - **403 Forbidden**: The client does not have permission to access this resource.
   - **404 Not Found**: Resource not found.
   - **500 Internal Server Error**: Generic server error.

## 4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**
   - Provide meaningful error messages in the response body.
   - Use standardized error formats (e.g., JSON with `code`, `message`, and `details` fields).
   - Document possible errors and responses for each endpoint in the folder `/app/responses/<resource_name>.py`.

## 5. **Version the API**
   - Include versioning in the URL (e.g., `/v1/cities`).
   - Use semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
   - Create changelogs for each version.

## 6. **Secure the API**
   - Use **HTTPS** for secure communication.
   - Implement **authentication** (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
   - Implement **authorization** to restrict access to resources.
   - Protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

## 7. **Use JSON as the Data Format**
   - JSON is widely supported and easy to read.
   - Ensure that the API supports both request and response bodies in JSON.

## 8. **Provide HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)**
   - Include links in responses to related resources (e.g., a link to a userâ€™s orders in the user response).
   - This enhances discoverability and helps clients navigate the API.

## 9. **Document the API**
   - Use tools like **Swagger/OpenAPI** to document the API endpoints, request/response formats, and errors.
   - Keep the documentation up to date.

## 10. **Optimize Performance**
   - Use caching headers (`ETag`, `Cache-Control`) where appropriate.
   - Minimize payload sizes by only returning necessary data.
   - Consider using compression (e.g., gzip) for large responses.

## 11. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Ensure consistency in naming conventions, response formats, and error handling across the entire API.
   - Use consistent response structures (e.g., always returning `data` and `errors` fields).

## 12. **Implement Rate Limiting and Throttling**
   - Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make in a given time period.
   - Use HTTP headers (e.g., `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`) to communicate rate limits.

## 13. **Use Asynchronous Processing**
   - For multiple tasks that take a long time to complete, consider using asynchronous processing.

## 14. **Use Consistent Time Formats**
   - Use ISO 8601 format for timestamps (e.g., `2024-08-09T12:00:00Z`).

## 15. **Design for Scalability**
   - Ensure that the API can handle an increasing number of requests as the API use grows.
   - Consider load balancing, horizontal scaling, and database optimization.

## 16. **Test the API**
   - Write unit and integration tests to ensure the API behaves as expected.
   - Test for edge cases, error conditions, and performance under load.
   - Use `pytest` for testing to ensure your application behaves as expected. Install `pytest` (if not already installed) and run tests with:
     ```sh
     pipenv install --dev pytest
     pytest
     ```

## 17. **API Lifecycle Management**
   - Plan for versioning and deprecating endpoints.
   - Provide clear communication to clients when endpoints or versions are deprecated.

## 18. **Code Formatting**
   - Use `black` for consistent code formatting. Run `black` using:
     ```sh
     black .
     ```

## 19. **Linting**
   - Use `pylint` to check for potential errors and enforce coding standards. Run `pylint` on your Python files with:
     ```sh
     pylint $(git ls-files 'app/*.py')
     ```
   - Configure `.pylintrc` as needed for project-specific settings.

## 20. **Type Checking**
   - Use `mypy` for type checking to catch type-related bugs. Run it using:
     ```sh
     mypy .
     ```

## 21. **Dependency Management**
   - Use `pipenv` to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across environments. If you add or update dependencies, make sure to lock them with:
     ```sh
     pipenv lock
     ```
   - Install dependencies from the `Pipfile.lock` to ensure a consistent environment:
     ```sh
     pipenv install --ignore-pipfile
     ```

## 22. **Code Review**
   - Participate in code reviews to ensure code quality and share knowledge with team members.

By following these best practices, we can build a REST API that is robust, easy to maintain, and provides a great experience for developers who use it.
